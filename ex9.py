days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun" # a string set up as a variable
months = "Jan\n\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug" # a string set up as a variable but /n denotes a break to move to the next line

print("here are the days:", days) #display the string with identifying text
print("here are the months:", months) # display the string with identifying text

print(""""
